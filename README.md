# R workshop for beginners. 

Those interested in learning R can have a look at Intro_to_R.pdf. For the curous minds, I have written the document in R Markdown. You can generate the Tex and pdf files by rendering the rmd file. 

R Markdown helps in reproducable research. What it means is that I have not copy pasted the tables and figures generated else where. This hopefully in the long run helps in reducing the amount of time spent on documenting my research.

If you plan to render the R Markdown file. Please create the following two folders in you working directory - 1) NSE BhavCopy 2) Output. NSE Bhavcopy folder is the location where the zip files dowloaded from web are stored. Output is the folder where files are written into.
